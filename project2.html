	<p style= "color: rgb(252, 3, 3); font-size:25px"> Julian Edelman has spent his entire career with the New England Patriots thus far. Although he was a quarterback in college, the Patriots began to use him primarily as a wide receiver, as they did not need another quarterback due to Tom Brady being on the team.  Edelman emerged to become one of the top receivers on the team as a rookie,  as well as become the primary punt-returner after he returned a 94 yard punt against Miami in 2010.  In 2011, Edelman made his first Super Bowl appearance, but ultimately lost the game. In 2013, he had his breakout season, catching 105 passes for 1,056 yards. He started receiving a larger share of targets from Brady throughout the postseason as the Patriots failed to make the Super Bowl that year. During the Patriots' 2014 Super Bowl run, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels utilized Edelman's quarterback ability, as Edelman threw a touchdown pass to Danny Amendola on a lateral pass play.  After totaling 109 receiving yards and a touchdown in Super Bowl 49, Edelman earned his first ring. To open the next season, he had back-to-back games of 10+ catches and later returned in the playoffs following an injury in the regular season. Edelman recorded a career-high 1,106 yards the next season, which was highlighted by his career-long 77 yard touchdown against Miami.  By then, Edelman became the clear number 1 receiver on the team, and this was demonstrated through his 342 yards over 3 postseason games. Edelman was also utilized as a cornerback on some plays too during the games. His difficult Super Bowl 51 catch was a key play that helped the Patriots rally back from a 25 point deficit against Atlanta to capture his second Super Bowl ring. Unfortunately, Edelman missed the next season due to a torn ACL, and was also suspended for the first 4 games of the 2018 season. After a slight decline in the regular season, Edelman helped the Patriots advance to their 3rd consecutive Super Bowl, where he was named Super Bowl 53 MVP for his performance of 10 receptions for 141 yards.  The following season has been highlighted by a TD pass to Phillip Dorsett and a game against Cleveland where he scored two touchdowns.  For his postseason performances, there has much been debate over whether he should be in the Hall of Fame or not. </p>
